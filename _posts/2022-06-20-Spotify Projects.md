### Project I: Wrapped All Year Around 
I made an **app** that continiously updates my Spotify Wrapped and shows it to me all year round...

I used Python, Spotify API, Google Sheets, and Glide to build the app. 

The code for the python ([is here](https://github.com/amenti4k/add-musik/blob/main/WrappedApp.ipynb)) if you want to try it youself... Additionally, the google/spotify api authentication might get tricky, so look up tutorials. 

### Project II: Custom Banger Song Recomendation
Exploring new music to find artists or songs that I like is just so damn good! Especially when the source is unexpected. 
I'm a song chaser more than sticking with an artist. Even with artists that I like, it's only most of their songs that appeals to me, while their other songs are admittedly just mid/bad. 


I've liked vibes and specific sounds more. 


To make the song finding process easier, I ran a few machine learning models on a playlist of 50 of my favourite songs and manualy rated them to train the dataset. 

Result is a 1.5k song that's scawered all over Spotify to find songs that are in close proximity to my eclectic taste. 
Surprisingly it seems to be working -- I've liked almost every song I've heard so far.


Will update soon, but the code is linked [here](https://github.com/amenti4k/add-musik)

And below is the playlist.

# Summer Playlist

And finally, my summer playlists that I've banged through Minnesota! I'll keep on updaing till the end of summer -- removing and adding songs till we finish!
